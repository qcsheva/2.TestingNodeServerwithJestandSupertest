App Setup
The setup for this app will contain the following three files:

app.js: Contains the express code to define and implement all of the HTTP routes.
app.test.js: Imports app.js and tests all of the endpoints.
server.js: Imports app.js and binds it to port 8080.
server.js will act as the entry point of the entire back end application that we can run with node 
server.js, and app.js only contains express specific code. Weâ€™ll see this separation come in handy even more in future articles.


What Are We Testing?
So in the test file, we are going to test that a POST request to /users works correctly. What does that mean? What exactly are we going to test?
