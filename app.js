// ----- Follow Steps as below ---------

// Step 1 - Express Apps
//create a new http server from the "express" library/function and bind it to a port to listen for HTTP requests
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

app.get('/test', (req, res) => {
  res.send("ðŸ¤—")
})

app.listen(8080, () => console.log("listening on port 8080"))

// Step 2 - When we write tests for the server using supertest,
//we can actually let supertest take care of the port binding
//which makes the tests much cleaner and easier to write. In order to do this,
//we wonâ€™t call app.listen here. Instead we should remove the app.listen line and just export app from this file.
//Then in our test file, we can import app and use supertest to test the api
export default app

// Step 3 -
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  //put code here
})

export default app
